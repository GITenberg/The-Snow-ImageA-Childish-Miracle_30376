description: A collection of short stories, originally published in 1851. 'Aside from
  his importance as a novelist, Hawthorne is justly celebrated as a short-story writer.
  He helped to establish the American short story as a significant art form with his
  haunting tales of human loneliness, frustration, hypocrisy, eccentricity, and frailty.'
  -- The Columbia Encyclopedia.
